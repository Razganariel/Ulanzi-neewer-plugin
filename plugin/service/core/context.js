/**
 * Action instance bookkeeping.
 *
 * The host identifies an action instance with a context string built by the SDK
 * as "<action uuid>___<key>___<actionid>", e.g.
 * "com.ulanzi.ulanzistudio.neewer.hue___3_3___7f1c...". That string is the only
 * handle we get on "which key holds which action", so two things have to hold:
 *
 *  - every event carries one, so the action can be recovered from it, and
 *  - a removal never leaves an entry behind that a later event would reuse.
 *
 * The second point is why this module exists. Removing an action and placing the
 * same action back on the same key has been observed to reach the service with
 * no fresh "add", so the context was absent from the map and every later event
 * for that key was dropped. The Ulanzi UI still showed the action, because the
 * host owns that view; the Stream Deck key stayed blank, because drawing it is
 * this plugin's job. Recovering the action from the context string closes that
 * gap without depending on an event the host may not send twice.
 *
 * A removal really does erase the entry, so a recovery after a clear starts from
 * the action defaults. The host answers the getSettings() that follows an add with
 * the real values, and falling back to the defaults for the frames in between is
 * visible and harmless, whereas inheriting a stale value would not be.
